# Keyboard Layout Optimizer

This application can search for optimal keyboard layouts. 
It combines two pieces of information to evaluate a given keyboard layout. 
* The first is a 'corpus', a body of text. This is the text that you want the keyboard layout to be optimal for. 
* The second input of the algorithm is your 'typing style', 
which is the time it takes you to press two particular keyboard positions in sequence.

## Usage
* Press 'Start' to use the currently selected keyboard layout to begin the algorithm. 
* Press 'Start with random' to initialize the algorithm with a randomly generated keyboard layout. 
* While running you can save the current optimal layout to your settings. 
* Press 'Settings' to determine the initial keyboard layout, the corpus, and the typing style you wish to use for the algorithm.
